				Mary: In practice, however, he was a shell of his former self. 
				Mary: To this day I'm not sure if what I'm grieving is his death or his cleansing. 
				Mary: I know it's just a watch. But I want it to stay as it is, no purification, no anything.

*Her face turns to a quick smile

Mary: I hated them all for it. I just wanted to hop around and catch my flies in silence.
Mary: I could do something about the crickets, but the birds were out of reach.
Mary: After a while, I cut my tiny frog ears off using a little frog knife.
Mary: And then I was at peace. Even stopped eating crickets. They didn't taste as good as the flies.

- Truth be told, Mary, as much as it pains me to say it, I think death is preferable to living here, in this place, in your situation.
	Mary: You're right. I know that, Keeper. Just a little harder to accept than I'd have liked right now. [do Variables.set_char_var("NPC_3", "relationship", 8)]

	Mary: Hope that humanity is not altogether doomed. Hope that Sarah will be alright, having someone like you looking out for her. 
	Mary: It makes letting go all the more difficult. But it also makes this final stretch of time more peaceful.

		Mary: ...
		Mary: I was hurting, Keeper. All alone. I had no one else. 
		Mary: I've always loved the children. Sarah, especially. But they reminded me of him. Of how we were unable to have any of our own. 
		Mary: And that was my fault...
		Mary: He had a daughter from his previous marriage. She died because of the cullings.

- Why is the watch so important to you? [if Variables.get_char_var("NPC_3", "opened_up") <= 1]

	Mary: But he wasn't the same after we joined the cult. He threw it away. I found it in the trash and kept it. 
	Mary: In theory, he was free of sin. In practice, however, he was a shell of his former self. 
	Mary: To this day I'm not sure if what I'm grieving is his death or his cleansing. 
	Mary: I know it's just a watch. But I wanted it to stay as it is, no purification, no nothing. 
	Mary: To remember him as he was before, now, in my final moments. [do Variables.set_char_var("NPC_3", "opened_up", 2)]

	Mary: Alas...
	Mary: Take good care of her, will you? And keep her away from that Micah boy. He's a mean little rascal.

		Mary: Appreciate that, Keeper. Really. => branch_know

	Mary: Or at least that's what I had myself believing.
	Mary: Never much cared for them, to be completely honest. But I loved making people laugh. 
	Mary: Loved making him laugh, most of all. 
	Mary: ... 
	Mary: He was very self serious, most of the time. 
	Mary: But if something got to him, he couldn't stop. He'd laugh for 10 minutes. And then, later in the day, he'd think about it again once or twice and laugh as if he'd heard it for the first time.
	Mary: Gun to my head, that's what I loved about him the most.
